Title:  Expand Your Creativity
Personal Headline:  It’s never too late to explore your creativity.
Personal Pitch: To illustrate adaptive and innovative creativity, my pitch has a slightly different bent from what is expected or normalized:

The Frank Sinatra song, "That's Life" well, that's me. Variably, I've been up and down and over and under, and everything in between, and through it all, I discovered one thing: I am a fascinating person with a lot of creative energy that needs to be put to good use immensely for maximum output. I love the creativity of software development and to work remotely for Amazon Studios in any creative capacity, would be the icing. Like Frank sang, I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a pawn and a king – now it's time for the poet in me to take the scene! Confidence and perseverance, that's the boost I bring to push me up and over and to the top!

What excites me most about software development is the challenging creativity and immense job opportunities. While I don’t expect to find lucrative employment in the tech world at my age and with the decrease in demand the field is currently experiencing, that doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of other opportunities to utilize advanced technical skills in programming and coding. I would like to utilize my skills in private and personal freelance contracting, to explore my own creativity and to help others expand their personal creative ventures.
